# Experimental Quantum Measurements

We do various qunatum measurements with instrument automation.

## An Example

Here, we will demonstrate the general lifetime measuring procedure for systems with lifetimes ranging from approximately 100 ns to longer timescales.

### Prerequisites

For experimental application with the attached code, we will need :

* Avalanche photodiode (APD) - for counting incoming photons.
* [Swabian Pulse Streamer 8/2](https://www.swabianinstruments.com/pulse-streamer-8-2/) - for pulsing various devices.
* [NIDAQmx, USB-6361](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/pcie-pxie-usb-6361-specs/page/specs.html) - for counting edges of the incoming pulses from APD.

### Running the tests

The steps are as follows, 

```
1. Initially, we link the devices to the PC. 
2. .....
```
